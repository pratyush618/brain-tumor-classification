## Overview

MRI Brain Tumor Detection is a project aimed at developing an advanced system for the detection and classification of brain tumors in MRI images. This project utilizes a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for accurate diagnosis.

## Features

- Hybrid CNN-SVM model for precise brain tumor detection and classification.
- Ability to classify different types of brain tumors, including meningioma, glioma, and pituitary gland tumors.
- Integration of hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance.
- Implementation of data preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality.
- Dataset with labeled MRI images for training and testing the model.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Potential for future enhancements using bio-inspired optimization methods.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The project uses the [MRI Brain Tumor Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VD2m1RW5s_Zb8fYwuyLTMFndBBJFvctN/view?usp=drive_link), which contains labeled MRI images for training and testing the model.
